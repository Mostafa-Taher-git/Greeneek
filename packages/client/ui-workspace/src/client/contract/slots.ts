/**
 * ui-workspace contracts. Two registrations share this package:
 *
 * - WorkspaceBrowser fills the sidebar shell's `sidebar.workspaces` hole —
 *   the whole browsing region (section header, search, grouped/flat session
 *   list, workspace dialogs). It registers this package's viewing store and
 *   consumes the shell's two-fact owner share (wide / expandSidebar).
 * - WorkspacePicker fills the conversation empty-state hole (menu + error
 *   dialog shared with the browser).
 *
 * Each registration also declares one **directory-flow hole** (`single`
 * kind): the slot a composed picker package's client half fills with its
 * picking interaction — a renderless native-chooser driver or an in-app
 * browsing dialog. ui-workspace owns the trigger (the "Add workspace…"
 * entry, present only while the hole is occupied) and the adoption
 * semantics (`createWorkspace({ path })`, the retryable error dialog,
 * Choose again); the occupant owns everything between `open` and the picked path,
 * including creating a new directory to hand back. That occupant-owned
 * creation is why adding a workspace has a single route: an unoccupied hole
 * leaves the surface with no add affordance at all.
 * Two holes exist because the two menu surfaces are independent slot entries
 * and a hole has exactly one declaring entry — they carry the same owner
 * contract and the same occupant.
